Then I was accosted by someone leaving at 3:30am who threatened me with violence simply because I questioned why he was there in the middle of the night. I informed the creator of the place and he suggested I do not return. He is obviously a willing participant. They even rented a room and promoted a group claiming they work for the reincarnation of Jesus Christ, whose name starts with Buddha? See attached photo.

The problem is my 3 year old and I shared my platter and both of us ended up getting food poisoning later that night. The one thing I remember consuming that tasted completely off was the avocado. It tasted like straight up rotten avocado but I dished up my kid’s food before trying everything. By then my child had consumed her entire avocado portion I gave her. We had come here with my sister and her family and our family friend. I asked everyone else if their avocado tasted rotten or weird at all and everyone said it tasted like it was seasoned just with lemon juice. By then I just plugged my nose and ate my entire portion of avocado because I didn’t want to waste anything.\\nIt was extremely dim even for the kitchen area so I wonder if that affected the ability to ensure no rotten food served.\\n\\nWe wanted to love this place because everything else tasted amazing and the atmosphere with the nearby playground was incredible.\\n\\nI put a picture of the plate my husband had.
