And yet day after day throngs of people arrive hours before it opens in order to line up and grab a pound of brisket before they sell out (they always sell out). So that should tell you all you need to know about how good the food is.\\n\\nInstead, I'll offer you these tips that I gathered from my three hours queuing and fifteen minutes of eating at Franklin one Sunday in September:\\n\\n- We arrived an hour before opening and wished we'd made it thirty minutes before as we narrowly missed the area in the line that was shaded from the sun. Whenever you're thinking of getting there, aim for thirty minutes before then... you'll inevitably be glad you did.\\n- Bring a bottle of water, a portable charger for your phone and something to read or listen to.\\n- The brisket, beef rib (when available) and pork rib are, in my opinion, the must order items.\\n- The sides are nothing to write home about and can easily be ignored without missing out on anything.\\n- You can go in the middle door to the lobby and buy beers or soft drinks and bring them back to your spot in the line, delighting your friends with your ingenuity and generosity.\\n\\nFranklin is worth it - honestly - but preparing for the experience with military precision can eliminate some of the annoying friction of it.\",\n",
