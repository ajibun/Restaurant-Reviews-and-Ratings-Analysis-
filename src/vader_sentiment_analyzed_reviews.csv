we got this delivered to our house in washington dc we went to texas last week and wanted to try this place however we heard that the line was very long and we didnt have time to do that so we ordered it to deliver to our house it took about a week to get what we ordered and we were very happy with them we got a brisket sausages and a barbecue sauce the package was still cold when delivered everything was delicious their barbecue sauce was amazing,2024-08-31,4.7,Franklin Barbecue,"900 E 11th St, Austin, TX 78702, USA",0.9099,Positive
"100100 hands down the best bbq in the country we have explored a lot and we would wait again for 4 hours to eat here we arrived at 7 am on a tuesday morning  we were the first in the parking lot but when we got to the line 4 others had beaten us there
brisket ribs and turkey were like no other the sausage was good and cant forget the pulled pork the spicy bbq sauce is the best
next time i wouldnt get any sides we tried them all but when the meat is so good you dont even need them
and dont forget the bourbon banana pie 
we are from out of state and got a brisket to take home to our friends its vacuum sealed
yes this place is worth the trip price and wait",2024-09-24,4.7,Franklin Barbecue,"900 E 11th St, Austin, TX 78702, USA",0.9796,Positive
franklin barbecue truly lives up to the hype the brisket was meltinyourmouth tender with a perfect smoky flavor that made it absolutely worth the wait the ribs and sausage were equally impressive each bite packed with rich savory goodness the sides especially the potato salad and coleslaw were fresh and paired beautifully with the meats the staff was friendly and kept the line moving smoothly if youre a barbecue lover franklin barbecue is a mustvisit its an experience you wont forget,2024-09-02,4.7,Franklin Barbecue,"900 E 11th St, Austin, TX 78702, USA",0.9853,Positive
"going to franklin takes a level of commitment that a platter of barbecued meats cant generally command and yet day after day throngs of people arrive hours before it opens in order to line up and grab a pound of brisket before they sell out they always sell out so that should tell you all you need to know about how good the food is

instead ill offer you these tips that i gathered from my three hours queuing and fifteen minutes of eating at franklin one sunday in september

 we arrived an hour before opening and wished wed made it thirty minutes before as we narrowly missed the area in the line that was shaded from the sun whenever youre thinking of getting there aim for thirty minutes before then youll inevitably be glad you did
 bring a bottle of water a portable charger for your phone and something to read or listen to
 the brisket beef rib when available and pork rib are in my opinion the must order items
 the sides are nothing to write home about and can easily be ignored without missing out on anything
 you can go in the middle door to the lobby and buy beers or soft drinks and bring them back to your spot in the line delighting your friends with your ingenuity and generosity

franklin is worth it  honestly  but preparing for the experience with military precision can eliminate some of the annoying friction of it",2024-09-22,4.7,Franklin Barbecue,"900 E 11th St, Austin, TX 78702, USA",0.6902,Positive
"without a doubt the greatest of all time

i cannot share enough good things about this amazing hotel it was the absolutely perfect spot for a little getaway from my husband and our baby the staff was so kind and accommodating from texts ahead of time to make sure we had everything we needed to even upgrading us to an incredible room by the pool the location could not get any better on south congress the pool was great the room was clean and spacious and perfectly styled and detailed the bed was very comfortable and the ac worked wonderfully the free cold water and free coffee was a great touch i love the calm relaxing aesthetic of every part of this hotel we loved it so much they allowed us to check in to our room early and they even let us keep our car there for a couple hours after we checked out so we could go to lunch i will highly recommend this to anyone i know visiting austin,2024-06-10,4.7,Hotel San José,"1316 S Congress Ave, Austin, TX 78704, USA",0.9954,Positive
"we came to austin for a quick girls weekend and really enjoyed our stay at hotel san jose the staff were very helpful and friendly the vibe overall was great we loved the design and decor of the property and our room the beds were comfy we liked the linens and the robes were so cute we also appreciated the ceiling fan in our room we enjoyed the location and close proximity to a lot of restaurants and shopping and it was fairly walkable were all city girls and are up for a decent walk to get places to different attractions the street in front of the hotel is pretty busy but our room was at the back of the property and very quiet it was pretty hot and humid during our stay so the pool was a perfect way to cool off in the afternoons it was also just a great area to lounge outside of your room the courtyard bar area seemed to be a hangout for both guests and folks not staying at the hotel so it was lively in a good way they also had breakfast tacos on saturday morning that were delicious there is a coffee shop nextdoor that is affiliated with the hotel so that was great for a quick drinkbite in the morning

my only real complaint was that the only mirror in the room was in the bathroom area it would be nice to have another mirror ideally full length in the main room area to make it easier for several people to get ready at the same time

note  the area can be a little buggy generally if you are sensitive to mosquitoes consider bringing bug spray",2024-05-28,4.7,Hotel San José,"1316 S Congress Ave, Austin, TX 78704, USA",0.9972,Positive

"lamberts is a great barbecue place if you are in the area the crispy wild boar ribs wer6e very flavorful and had somewhat of an asian influence i would definitely highly recommend this appetizer to start with i had the two meat plate which i would say is good the brisket was lean meaty and somewhat tender if youre looking for extra moist brisket this is not it however the flavor was good and the sides that i got were collard greens and coleslaw both of these sides were not bad

i really enjoyed that the table came with three different sauces my favorite probably was the mustard and then the hot and then the house i saw some of my coworkers really lather their barbecue with the house sauce so that might say something about it it was a little bit vinegary for me however thats not a bad thing

i would say that if youre in the area and craving bbq this is not a bad place to go with me living up north i would not make a specific trip to come here as it would be a little bit out of my way",2024-04-12,4.4,Lamberts,"401 W 2nd St, Austin, TX 78701, USA",0.972,Positive

"clay pit good kebabs frustrating service disappointing drinks

i recently visited clay pit contemporary indian cuisine in austin tx prior to the tim mcgraw concert eager to relive some of the incredible flavors i experienced traveling throughout india the kebabs and curry did not disappoint the tandoori kebabs were perfectly cooked and bursting with flavor a true taste of tradition

however the service left a lot to be desired we had a 500 pm reservation for three but upon arrival we were informed they wouldnt seat us until our entire party was present  our daughter who had just arrived on an international flight was stuck in traffic 15 minutes away  while the restaurant wasnt packed with only six other patrons and several empty tables they were unwilling to accommodate us for seating this inflexibility was frustrating especially considering our extenuating circumstances

the food as mentioned tandoori kebabs were good  however skip the cocktails my indian nights drink was a major letdown it was watery and barely tasted of gin a far cry from the photo on the menu

overall clay pit is a mixed bag the food is good but the service needs improvement and the cocktails are a definite miss and avoid while i wouldnt recommend it wholeheartedly or plan to return myself if youre looking for an indian food experience in austin and prioritize the food over everything else it might be worth a try just be prepared for a potentially inflexible seating policy and underwhelming drinks",2024-06-04,4.2,Clay Pit Contemporary Indian Cuisine,"1601 Guadalupe St, Austin, TX 78701, USA",0.8629,Positive

experience that is very rare these days we are huge foodies and eating great food is our hobby with the attention to detail truluck at every turn the price paid for the meal was an exceptional value i will definitely be back",2024-08-11,4.7,Truluck's Ocean's Finest Seafood & Crab,"300 Colorado St, Austin, TX 78701, USA",0.997,Positive
"my wife and i visited kerbey lane for breakfast i ordered a harvest omelet comprised of 3 eggs  cheddar jack cheese green onions  green pepper  onion  sliced mushroom and avocado i chose for my 2 sides  an english muffin and seasoned home fries my wife had an avocado toast made up of hummus sliced avocado cucumbers and a sunny side up egg garnished with cherry tomatoes and green onion  my wife chose black beans as her side

the harvest omelet was very tasty as was the english muffin sadly  the home fries were overcooked and dry more reflective of boxed home fries than of fresh home fries

my wifes avocado toast delivered  with great flavor the big surprise were the black beans  which had a well balanced mild hint of garlic and a slight well received chili like kick

the atmosphere is spacious and appropriately bright  the service was average

i stopped by this location during the lunch hour to pick up some lunch time bbq i observed customers seated throughout the restaurant eating lunch when i visited there appears to be limited seating at this location as observed i ordered chicken beef and pork ribs to go i noted that i was given only one set of plastic utensils for a large order to go its a good thing i noticed and grabbed some needed utensils on my way out of the restaurant my order came with fries and the worker pointed to some that were warming the fries were not worthy of more than three  i threw more than half of them away because they were hard and stale the beef was sliced when i ordered it for my sandwich it was wrapped and prepared the half chicken and pork ribs that i ordered were wrapped in paper as well i sampled all of the meats and it was well prepared and cooked to taste  the parking in this area is not good i would not want to drive to this location and have to pay an exorbitant amount to find a parking location",2024-04-26,4.3,Iron Works Barbecue,"100 Red River St, Austin, TX 78701, USA",0.8258,Positive
"this was my second time coming to iron works barbecue first visit was unremarkablehad no complaints as a frequent out of town visitor i do appreciate how closeconvenient it is to my hotel

the turkey sandwich was 710 it was a little slim on meat compared to the amount of bun the turkey was smokey but the outside crust was a little too pepper heavy for my liking i would come back but try something else next time

i was mostly put off by the customer service experience i had during this visit from someone named marie marie took my order in the kitchen window  she must be having a pretty crap day to treat a customer the way she treated me when i approached and said hello she didnt reply or reciprocate  thats fine when i asked a question about a sandwich she was instantly annoyed in both tone and body language when i asked where to get some sauce she said if i would give her a minute she would be packing it into my bag it wasnt  even busy so i was confused as to why she was so frustrated with my existence

when i got my sandwich  there was no bbq sauce even tho i asked previously i returned and asked for a few she questioned whether i even looked and i opened the box to show her she said nothing else and slid one across the counter and walked away from me when i please asked for one more cup she stomped back to the window and actually tossed it at me i was lucky it didnt break open all over my shirt

the whole thing was a bit shocking and for an adult  i think she might need a minor lesson in mutual respect",2024-09-26,4.3,Iron Works Barbecue,"100 Red River St, Austin, TX 78701, USA",-0.0943,Negative
iron works never fails at the taste of some good texas barbecue so much that celebrities and other high end go and stop and eat there who knows maybe one day you can acutally come across someone that is being introduced to texas barbecue the brisket beef is a must and i think its one of their most signature plates out there of course there is other options available to you if you want other meats but some authentic texas barbecue is brisket beef of course during the summer get ready to pick up some sweat as it will get hot from your surroundings overall i do recommend eating here so enjoy it and sundays they are closed,2024-07-22,4.3,Iron Works Barbecue,"100 Red River St, Austin, TX 78701, USA",0.9365,Positive

"a phenomenal dinner experience from start to finish having read reviews and receiving recommendations from others i was expecting a good experience but it definitely surpassed my expectations

we used the valet parking which is the garage in the same block it was 15 and very quick and easy

our service was impeccable from our hostess and especially our waiter sam to others who checked on us through the experience to make sure we were well taken care of  sam was the perfect level of attentiveness without being overbearing with very spoton recommendations for both food and drinks

they do an amazing job making you feel valued and special and i believe everyone that we interacted with knew that we were celebrating an anniversary and wished us well which was very touching

for appetizers we had the chicken fried lobster which was phenomenal it came with a tomato butter which i personally am not a fan of tomatoes but it was light and not overpowering and my partner especially loved the leftovers on the delicious bread we also had the off menu bone marrow which came with delicious toast like bread in a very generous amount

for dinner we had a classic eye of ribeye pepper steak medium rare with the oscar style top of crab hollandaise sauce and asparagus the sauce and the oscar style toppings were phenomenal and the steak perfectly cooked i had them served on the side and both were so amazing that i couldnt tell you which was better and i could probably eat the oscar style as a whole dish honestly

we also had the truffled mushroom burger with the king sauce another amazing recommendation  very rich and also perfectly cooked to medium rare

we got the fried thai chili brussels sprouts as well as the six cheese potatoes for sides the sprouts were very flavorful and had a perfect crunch the potatoes were good but i felt a little bit bland compared to the other dishes and could have used some additional salt

they brought us a surprise for dessert which included the chocolate and texas pecan cake one of the best parts of the meal was probably the homemade bootleg irish cream which was very thick and creamy and had hints of coconut as well as i felt banana definitely a reason to come back for my birthday dinner ha ha

for two people it was a ton of food and we left very full and satisfied and have leftovers for dinner the next night

overall it was an exceptional experience from the moment we walked in until the moment we drove away a wonderful date night or special occasion place for us to visit again in the future",2024-06-25,4.6,III Forks,"111 Lavaca St, Austin, TX 78701, USA",0.9994,Positive

it wasnt my idea to come here it was my friends because i have genius friends they were always intrigued by the strange looking whip in sign off the side of the highway beconing people to try their indian food who wouldnt be intrigued so we arrived ordered some beers they have a wide variety and sat outside on the patio im kicking myself now for not taking some great pictures of ganesh  next time

after a while we decide to order some food and settle on

paneer tikka  quite nice it comes with a sauce and lime which compliments the flavour
bhindi masala  mild with nice flavor i didnt get the slimy texture i usually get with okra which was a plus
spicy paneer tikka masal  i liked this one because it was creamy with a good amount of heat

"we went to eat at pluckers as we normally do normally everything is very delicious of course we usually go in the afternoons this time we decided to go for lunch it is worth mentioning that we are frequent customers at this location in rio grande this time we ordered the appetizers and after 5 minutes they asked us if we were ready to order the food and we said yes although we still didnt have our apetazier half an hour later the cold appetizers arrived completely cold some of the fries were hard and difficult to eat after 5 minutes the food arrived food also cold but i only told the waitress that our appetizers were cold then we ordered a brownie that came almost frozen and on this occasion i decided to ask to speak to the manager a short girl who wears a red shirt she cameto our table  i told her about the brownie with the fries and she offered to reheat the brownie i told her no thanks and she insisted a lot and took it away  but she came back with another different brownie cut in half too thin my children started to eat eat it but i suggested that they not do it since  it looked a little strange anyway the manager returned to the table with a somewhat abrupt attitude when she asking obviously you could see the discontent in her attitude when she asking if we liked the brownie i responded that i didnt even dare to touch the brownie  and she ignored me i dont know why she ask if i liked it  perhaps by inertia  anyway this location deserves a better manager or better staff maybe training   we have more than 10000 points accumulated in the pluckers application  and this location is the closest to our department it is sad to have to go to other locations further away to receive good service some warm wings and a brownie at least well heated in the microwave the next time i see one of the founders of pluckers ill make the comment its a shame ive only seen them in that location
i forgot to mention that we piled up the plates near the edge of the table before ordering the brownie and neither the waitress nor the manager removed them remember that the manager was at the table three times and all 3 times the stack of plates was there and never she bothered to remove them i insist on thet should returning to training  especially her and her staff in the kitchen",2024-03-03,4.2,Pluckers Wing Bar,"2222 Rio Grande St Ste D116, Austin, TX 78705, USA",0.9132,Positive

elizabeth street cafe is a culinary gem that left me thoroughly impressed the appetizers set the tone for an exceptional meal with the poached shrimp spring rolls offering a fresh start and the pork belly buns stealing the show with their unbelievably soft texture the main courses were equally delightful featuring a perfect pairing of singapore noodles and red curry noodles that offered contrasting yet complementary experiences  the former a satisfying dry noodle dish while the latter consisted of a comforting brothy soup the restaurants attention to detail extends beyond the food with craft cocktails that are as visually stunning as they are delicious the quick and friendly service enhanced the overall experience and the charming fun decor created a delightful ambience elizabeth street cafe is a mustvisit destination for anyone seeking a memorable dining experience that seamlessly blends flavors presentation and atmosphere,2024-09-01,4.3,Elizabeth Street Café,"1501 S 1st St, Austin, TX 78704, USA",0.9892,Positive

my mother was visiting me for the first time after moving to austin and i wanted to take her somewhere nice for lunch since im gluten free we planned which day we would go based on the weekly menu thats published for the buffet there isnt the quantity of food that wed typically see at a vegas buffet but the price quality and presentation of the food more than made up for it we ate until we couldnt eat any more the staff was very friendly and the signs clearly posted which items were gluten free i believe theres no parking validation for lunchtime but overall its still cheaper than going to vegas to meet for a buffet lunch,2023-09-07,4.5,The Carillon,"1900 University Ave, Austin, TX 78705, USA",0.9324,Positive
"beautiful atmosphere so we were surprised it was mostly empty for a brunch buffet  especially at a reasonably price as it is  beautiful room and furnishings  lovely

lovely mimosas good coffee a rather sparse buffet of oatmeal pancakes scrambled eggs only not other options sausage bacon potatoes and premade processed syscostyle breads for toasting plain fruit  no desserts or omelettes or anything such as that but that would have been great for mehad the bacon not been literally rancid and the bagels horribly stale

we all noticed the issue with the bacon but i was quite sure they were aware of it because of the issue with the bagels  i grabbed one and it was so hard so stale that i said out loud without realizing it oh my god these are horribly stale we were there right when they opened so they had clearly reused them rather than them being out all day

fortunately a staff member did hear me and asked if i would like a fresh one  she got out the bag to assist me which was very kind  she likely replaced them after that

the eggs were good though not hot  and the potatoes were as well  the items are not served in chafing dishes which may be the cause of the spoiled bacon if they reused it from the day before or god forbid now that i think about it last week  it wasnt a question or a maybe the bacon had gone bad  and it was evident  all food is in cast iron pans not chafers to keep the food fresh and at controlled temperatures

initially our service was great but we waited for 40 minutes after finishing to get our bill  no refills no  checkins   we did have both initially but then all staff were absent and we could not leave my first old plate sat under a new one because there was no service to remove it  by 1130 we wandered around the empty restaurant looking for anyone to help us so that we could leave as two of us had rides waiting  we could not find our waitress still but were assisted by another waiter who went to find her  it was totally empty by that time

i would rather pay double for fresh food and some thought of the offerings such as an eggs benedict or an omelette station or some fresh pastries or desserts or some interesting other offerings like perhaps migasit was so plain so simple and sadly 2 items being reused when they were very bad that we would not return

i take that back i would try cocktails here in the evening because we love the atmosphere but brunch is empty for good reason so each of our table of 8 would need to decline that option",2024-01-29,4.5,The Carillon,"1900 University Ave, Austin, TX 78705, USA",0.9919,Positive

"nostalgia history and these darn tootin creative signs that change regularly with spontaneous comedic text this place has made a name for itself in memes across the internet and in the hearts of austin

got the queso and a shrimp and crab cream cheese enchilada was pretty delicious actually tasted a bit like crab dip which actually seemed about right after rereading the description on the menu  i dont know that i would order that again because its a lot of the same taste but it was good  perhaps if one were sharing that and something else it would be good to mix and match  that said the plate was big enough to share between two lots of rice and beans and two big enchiladas

the design of the place is pretty cool they have a cut apart school bus outside that is pretty neat  with fun artistic design of the place in general  there is both indoor and outdoor seating the outdoors probably more artistic but ended up sitting inside because it was hot out

you can also kind of gift shop christmas ornaments magnets etc of the oh so famous the sign  the ornaments were about 20 in september of 2024",2024-09-18,4.1,El Arroyo,"1624 W 5th St, Austin, TX 78703, USA",0.9923,Positive

lovely place with really attentive and entertaining staff unfortunately i just really think the menu is not all that good when they bring out tortillas theyre incredibly hard and difficult most of the food is just not convenient to eat and the flavors are not all that great if youre going to do family style make it convenient to portion ceviche was not that great either i get that they are doing their own take on traditional dishes but i just dont think their take is neither tasty nor convenient in the way they prepare and serve it the flavors are also uninspiring some more than others the guacamole was just guacamole but quite expensive this seem to be the recurring theme the dishes were the some of their parts but there was nothing transcendent in terms of flavor about any of it and this is a shame because mexican food really can be done in an upscale way and be amazing just not this chef,2024-09-02,4.2,La Condesa,"400 W 2nd St A, Austin, TX 78701, USA",-0.3386,Negative

"april 2024

hoovers cooking is all about serving the local community with southern comfort food much of which is locally sourced i have dined here before a few times in the past and was excited to return  it is located in an area full of new popular eateries but this place is a landmark there was plenty of parking and was easy to find it is all table seating except a few booths

i noticed the staff took their time to seat and serve you no rushing which made me feel more like being at my parents it was very calm  i also noticed the love rocks tx slogan all over with a huge collection of painted rocks to spread love which remind when i myself painted a rock during covid there was a charm about this place watching an older man painting away

i ordered the 2pc fried chicken dark with 2 house mates macaroni  cheese and green beans and sweet tea from looking around this place it displays local austin history all around including items from the frisco shop once our heavy plates of food arrived the fried chicken looked very good the food was very hot  i tried a chicken leg and the crust was crunchy and tasty  the chicken was also very delicious the mac  cheese was great along with the green beans which had chunks of brisket in it overall it was really good where it was not spicy at all and perfect for older folks really good fried chicken

service was about as bad as it gets the server was rude and blatantly unfriendly when taking our order rather than explaining what we could get with our chilaquiles he turned his screen around and made us read through the options on his pos system

"we went to casa de luz last night and it was the cutest place everything was fantastic the problem is my 3 year old and i shared my platter and both of us ended up getting food poisoning later that night the one thing i remember consuming that tasted completely off was the avocado it tasted like straight up rotten avocado but i dished up my kids food before trying everything by then my child had consumed her entire avocado portion i gave her we had come here with my sister and her family and our family friend i asked everyone else if their avocado tasted rotten or weird at all and everyone said it tasted like it was seasoned just with lemon juice by then i just plugged my nose and ate my entire portion of avocado because i didnt want to waste anything
it was extremely dim even for the kitchen area so i wonder if that affected the ability to ensure no rotten food served

we wanted to love this place because everything else tasted amazing and the atmosphere with the nearby playground was incredible

we had the mussels beef tartare duck and steak

mussels were fantastic and delicious theyre from the bar menu

the beef tartare was cut a little too big and the color was brownish they had a sprinkle of cinnamon on the bread unfortunately i could not keep eating this as it reminded me of pumpkin spice cat food i would not order it again

the steak was cooked well but we found the horseradish butter to be very mild and overall it seemed like a very muted dish we were expecting some commitment to the flavor

the duck was good but i found it to be too salty and i also couldnt finish my plate

we walked in and where immediately greeted and seated

james was our server whom educated that this is the original kerbey lane that opened in 1980

love his hospitality

the inside is so clean and has the most amazing art dcor hanging all over the walls

the menu and food is what you would expect for vegan gluten free options

i ordered
vegan breakfast platter vg
two dr praegers veggie patties  tofu scramble topped with green onions  fresh diced tomatoes served with two half size vegan vanilla swirl pancakes
cost 1299
i started with the tofu scramble and veggie patties they both were full of flavors my pallet was extremely happy with the texture to the tofu scramble the veggie patties to me where a bit too soft and could have been cooked a bit longer so the inside was not mushy

the two vegan gluten free vanilla swirl pancakes are the best and i mean the best pancakes i have ever eaten they were fluffy moist and full of flavor if you were not aware these are vegan and gluten free and wow i am honestly speechless at the texture the taste the way the cinnamon vanilla swirl enhanced the pancakes in a way that they were extremely sweet to a point i had to take them home to finish what an amazing tasting dish

my friend ordered
french toast platter v
two slices of french toast two eggs any style  choice of all natural bacon sausage or seasonal fresh fruit 1229

they advised that the french toast was cooked to perfection full fluffy and not egg tasting they ordered over easy eggs which where cooked perfectly the seasonal fruit however was not good the honeydew and cantaloupe were not ripe and the strawberrys felt rubbery to a point i spat the strawberry out as soon as i took a bite of it we both tried the fruit to ensure that they were definitely not ripe and that the texture was off

the cleanliness is off the charts as well as the service

"came to the restaurant on a busy friday night parking was a little crazy restaurant gives the impression that only valet parking is available but you can self park if you wish

we were told it would be hour wait when we arrived after 6pm but only waited for about 20 minutes before we were seated

this is a great tex mex restaurant excellent service and great food salsa is a tad spicy and delicious food came out quickly even on a very busy night the only complaint i have is the noise level in the restaurant due to the high ceilings all the sounds echo which made it difficult to have conversations at dinner table",2024-05-21,4.4,Matt's El Rancho,"2613 S Lamar Blvd, Austin, TX 78704, USA",0.9712,Positive
"came here on a busy sunday brunch we were promptly seated for a group of 8

the servers were kind and friendly they were quick to get us what we needed and we never felt rushed the inside was massive but didnt feel overwhellming there was ample space for multiple large groups of people

the food was above average i wouldnt say it was in my top 5 of mexicanamerican food but overall it was good

"the place for texmex in austin
i have been going to matts for many years they have excellent food  its my go to place for their brisket tacos  they are prepared just right with a wonderful slightly smokey flavor  the meat is juicy and flavorful the accompanying in house tortillas are excellent  i have to admit they are a bit smaller than in the past but remain of excellent quality
i also enjoy their chips and salsa  the salsa has a nice home grown flavor the tomato is sweet and the salsa isnt too hot allowing the flavors to come through  some salsas have too much of a vinegar or preservative flavor not so here  the chips are good too nice and large not a pile of crumbles

i didnt have it this time around but their fajitas are also top notch

to top it off the restaurant is a great venue  it has a quaint outdoors backyard area with ample tree coverage and nice fountain  kids love the koi in the fountain and birds that pickup food scraps from the tables   the backyard is enclosed by a wall giving the setting a nice sense of privacy
they have a bar inside and out making it easy to get a drink  all in all just a great dining experience",2024-05-19,4.4,Matt's El Rancho,"2613 S Lamar Blvd, Austin, TX 78704, USA",0.9971,Positive

"starting by saying the food was amazing lots of appetizer choices which were all great i got the sushisashimi chefs choice combo and it was incredible even the half teriyaki order for my kid was delicious also kudos for offering that the cocktailwine selection was ok but overall a great variety on top of that the atmosphere was perfect  intimate but not too loud laid back but just a bit edgy
our server however was awful had an attitude the entire time and looked at us like we were inconveniencing her by asking minor questions  my brother asked if anything special was done for birthdays and after a long pause she just said mochi which i never even got we had to call her every time we wanted a drink and she didnt offer to go over the chefs selections with us we wouldve much rather had been served by her apprentice who was super sweet
overall the food and ambiance was great but the server did sort of sour our experience",2024-05-10,4.5,Musashino Sushi Dokoro,"2905 San Gabriel St Suite 200, Austin, TX 78705, USA",0.9916,Positive
