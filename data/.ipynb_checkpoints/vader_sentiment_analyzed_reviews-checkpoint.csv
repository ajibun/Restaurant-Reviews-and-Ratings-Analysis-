"We got this delivered to our house in Washington DC. We went to Texas last week and wanted to try this place. However, we heard that the line was very long and we didn't have time to do that. So we ordered it to deliver to our house. It took about a week to get what we ordered and we were very happy with them. We got a brisket, sausages and a barbecue sauce. The package was still cold when delivered. Everything was delicious. Their barbecue sauce was amazing.",2024-08-31,5,Franklin Barbecue,"900 E 11th St, Austin, TX 78702, USA",0.9099,Positive
"100/100 hands down the best bbq in the country. We have explored a lot and we would wait again for 4 hours to eat here. We arrived at 7 am on a Tuesday morning.  We were the first in the parking lot. But when we got to the line, 4 others had beaten us there.
Brisket, Ribs, and turkey were like no other. The sausage was good. And can‚Äôt forget the pulled pork. The spicy bbq sauce is the best.
Next time I wouldn‚Äôt get any sides. We tried them all, but when the meat is so good you don‚Äôt even need them.
And don‚Äôt forget the bourbon banana pie üòãüòãüòã
We are from out of state and got a brisket to take home to our friends. It‚Äôs vacuum sealed.
Yes this place is worth the trip, price, and wait!!",2024-09-24,5,Franklin Barbecue,"900 E 11th St, Austin, TX 78702, USA",0.9674,Positive
"Franklin Barbecue truly lives up to the hype! The brisket was melt-in-your-mouth tender with a perfect smoky flavor that made it absolutely worth the wait. The ribs and sausage were equally impressive, each bite packed with rich, savory goodness. The sides, especially the potato salad and coleslaw, were fresh and paired beautifully with the meats. The staff was friendly and kept the line moving smoothly. If you‚Äôre a barbecue lover, Franklin Barbecue is a must-visit. It's an experience you won‚Äôt forget!",2024-09-02,5,Franklin Barbecue,"900 E 11th St, Austin, TX 78702, USA",0.984,Positive
"Going to Franklin takes a level of commitment that a platter of barbecued meats can't generally command. And yet day after day throngs of people arrive hours before it opens in order to line up and grab a pound of brisket before they sell out (they always sell out). So that should tell you all you need to know about how good the food is.

Instead, I'll offer you these tips that I gathered from my three hours queuing and fifteen minutes of eating at Franklin one Sunday in September:

- We arrived an hour before opening and wished we'd made it thirty minutes before as we narrowly missed the area in the line that was shaded from the sun. Whenever you're thinking of getting there, aim for thirty minutes before then... you'll inevitably be glad you did.
- Bring a bottle of water, a portable charger for your phone and something to read or listen to.
- The brisket, beef rib (when available) and pork rib are, in my opinion, the must order items.
- The sides are nothing to write home about and can easily be ignored without missing out on anything.
- You can go in the middle door to the lobby and buy beers or soft drinks and bring them back to your spot in the line, delighting your friends with your ingenuity and generosity.

Franklin is worth it - honestly - but preparing for the experience with military precision can eliminate some of the annoying friction of it.",2024-09-22,5,Franklin Barbecue,"900 E 11th St, Austin, TX 78702, USA",0.7646,Positive
"Without a doubt the Greatest of All Time!

Believe the hype. Dig the craft. Drink the Beer. Eat the BBQ! Live the dream.

Transformative slow smoked meats. Brisket is truly the finest in the world. Turkey will blow your mind. The sausages are exceptional and unique.",2024-09-17,5,Franklin Barbecue,"900 E 11th St, Austin, TX 78702, USA",0.4983,Positive
"I cannot share enough good things about this amazing hotel! It was the absolutely perfect spot for a little getaway from my husband and our baby! The staff was so kind and accommodating from texts ahead of time to make sure we had everything we needed to even upgrading us to an incredible room by the pool. The location could not get any better on South Congress! The pool was great, the room was clean and spacious and perfectly styled and detailed. The bed was very comfortable and the ac worked wonderfully. The free cold water and free coffee was a great touch! I love the calm relaxing aesthetic of every part of this hotel. We loved it so much! They allowed us to check in to our room early and, they even let us keep our car there for a couple hours after we checked out so we could go to lunch. I will highly recommend this to anyone I know visiting Austin!",2024-06-10,5,Hotel San Jos√©,"1316 S Congress Ave, Austin, TX 78704, USA",0.9956,Positive
"We came to Austin for a quick girls weekend and really enjoyed our stay at Hotel San Jose. The staff were very helpful and friendly. The vibe overall was great. We loved the design and decor of the property and our room. The beds were comfy, we liked the linens, and the robes were so cute. We also appreciated the ceiling fan in our room. We enjoyed the location and close proximity to a lot of restaurants and shopping, and it was fairly walkable (we‚Äôre all city girls and are up for a decent walk to get places) to different attractions. The street in front of the hotel is pretty busy, but our room was at the back of the property and very quiet. It was pretty hot and humid during our stay, so the pool was a perfect way to cool off in the afternoons. It was also just a great area to lounge outside of your room. The courtyard bar area seemed to be a hangout for both guests and folks not staying at the hotel, so it was lively (in a good way). They also had breakfast tacos on Saturday morning that were delicious. There is a coffee shop nextdoor that is affiliated with the hotel, so that was great for a quick drink/bite in the morning.

My only real complaint was that the only mirror in the room was in the bathroom area. It would be nice to have another mirror (ideally full length) in the main room area to make it easier for several people to get ready at the same time.

Note:  The area can be a little buggy generally. If you are sensitive to mosquitoes, consider bringing bug spray.",2024-05-28,5,Hotel San Jos√©,"1316 S Congress Ave, Austin, TX 78704, USA",0.9968,Positive
We stayed here for a girls trip and it was absolute perfection. The staff were so generous and kind. Rooms were very spacious and we loved the lounge and pool to spend time together as group. You truly forget you are on bustling South Congress because the grounds are so lush and filled with birds. We booked the adjoining courtyard king rooms to allow for space for five and it was PERFECT for a group staying together. The balconies overlooking the lounge felt so special! Absolutely will visit again!,2024-04-18,5,Hotel San Jos√©,"1316 S Congress Ave, Austin, TX 78704, USA",0.9816,Positive
"We love staying at Hotel San Jose. Immaculate vibes, insanely good location, and great service. Tiffany went above and beyond to make sure we were having fun and were taken care of.

"100000/10 place. Couldn‚Äôt recommend enough! I booked this place in May for my sisters college graduation. Unfortunately, I had one of the worst travel days of my life that had me coming in for 12 hours later than what I was supposed to. Because of that, I probably spent 8 hours total at the place and they went above and beyond for me and my sister. They gave us free champagne because I was keeping them up to date on my travels, some cute lil goodies for us and a beautiful hand written note letting us know those things were on the house and they were so sorry about my travel day. AMAZING staff, excellent communication, beautiful hotel and really great location to go bop around. I will always stay at this hotel when I come to Austin!!! You guys are the best and should have a 5/5 on Google for how well you treat your guests. Thank you!!!",2024-07-04,5,Hotel San Jos√©,"1316 S Congress Ave, Austin, TX 78704, USA",0.9906,Positive
Ate dinner here the other night. Got the ‚ÄúStubb‚Äôs Minor‚Äù plate with brisket and sausage. Brisket was a little cold and mostly fat. My server was very friendly and knowledgeable as well as the rest of the staff I interacted with. Wish the food was a little better but I‚Äôll definitely try this place again!,2024-09-18,4,Stubb's Bar-B-Q,"801 Red River St, Austin, TX 78701, USA",0.8516,Positive
"Hey, so we stopped at Stubb's Bar-B-Q and it was totally worth it! The place has a really cool vibe. The restaurant and a small bar are on the first floor, and then downstairs they have a concert area and another bar. The staff was super friendly and quick with our orders. The food was amazing! We got the pulled pork sandwich with mac and cheese and fries on the side. The mac and cheese was bomb! We also ordered the three-meat sampler with brisket, pulled pork, and ribs. The ribs were my favorite! We also got some cornbread and fried okra, which were both really good. We'll definitely be going back!",2024-08-17,5,Stubb's Bar-B-Q,"801 Red River St, Austin, TX 78701, USA",0.9667,Positive
"I went for lunch alone, it was not crowded around 12pm but it was getting busier after 1230pm. I am not much a fan of red meat, take my review as a grain of salt. I ordered ribs, it was tender but a little bit salty to me (I usually eat plain); fried okra was good, not too dry. This place is good for family hangout, they have many big tables and great deal for a group. I heard they have evening show is hosted at basement. Everyone is friendly and attentive.",2024-03-30,4,Stubb's Bar-B-Q,"801 Red River St, Austin, TX 78701, USA",0.9494,Positive
"Parking was difficult to find along the road, and some guy came up to ask for money while we were unloading.  We had to wait about 20 mins downstairs for our table, which ended up fine because we were able to explore a couple of their music stages down there.  The service staff were friendly and the atmosphere felt historical or old in some way.  The food was good, though pricey, heavy and a bit greasy.  Not sure we'd come back next time around.",2024-04-18,4,Stubb's Bar-B-Q,"801 Red River St, Austin, TX 78701, USA",0.5327,Positive
The place is laid back almost like a time warp back to simpler times. Food is good but getting parking can be a bit of a hassle so plan accordingly. Staff is great and attentive. Ask for bathroom directions as you walk in and you won't get lost. They can just point it out to you. They are in the basement and you have to make many turns to get there.,2024-04-10,5,Stubb's Bar-B-Q,"801 Red River St, Austin, TX 78701, USA",0.8921,Positive
"Delicious food. Friendly service! Massive quantity. I finished a fourth of the plate. We had the pork chop, chicken & waffles, old fashioned, shrimp corn dogs, corn bread, popcorn. The food was amazing. There is an outside area with fans and mist for hot days.",2024-09-25,5,Moonshine Grill,"303 Red River St, Austin, TX 78701, USA",0.8999,Positive
"Loved the atmosphere as it was in an old house on a nondescript street in Austin, Texas. Service was great! Attentive but not over bearing. The food (I‚Äôd say the food vibe is elevated comfort food)was good but not delicious. My favorite thing was the free popcorn they bring to your table. Quite tasty! My cocktail, a Blind Mule, was quite yummy. I would go back, but I wouldn‚Äôt rush back.",2024-07-09,4,Moonshine Grill,"303 Red River St, Austin, TX 78701, USA",0.9082,Positive
"I was visiting Austin with my friend and we went here 3 times during our 4 day stay so it is safe to say that we thoroughly loved it here! The food, service, and atmosphere were all excellent. I loved the unique touch of having complimentary popcorn. During our visits we tried the hangar steak, rainbow trout, blackened catfish, pork ribs, and chicken almondine. Every dish was a hit! All of the staff were amazing, but especially Cassie who had excellent recommendations to really sell the menu. It was great to see the staff helping each other out and making the service so seamless. They also offered a complimentary dessert to celebrate my friend's birthday.",2024-08-15,5,Moonshine Grill,"303 Red River St, Austin, TX 78701, USA",0.9899,Positive

"We‚Äôve been to their Avery location but never the original one downtown here. We are in the patio bar area, the guys there Charles and Sean were so nice! It was me and my husbands wedding anniversary, they made it such a pleasant experience, I had the rainbow trout and he had the pork chop. Super tasty! It was about a 25min wait upstairs so we just ate at the bar there. It‚Äôs in a historic building, gorgeous old features and hardwood floors. Would definitely recommend!",2024-08-13,5,Moonshine Grill,"303 Red River St, Austin, TX 78701, USA",0.9825,Positive
"Feel-good tunes and balanced mix of open air and air conditioned seating available. We came toward the end of the night and were seated inside right away. Happy hour is from 4:30 - 6:30 pm daily and can get busy. Our server, Tarah, was exceptional and recommended the daily special, which was from Spain and was the most lean and tender pork, seared to perfection. We tried some of their classics as well (deviled eggs, duck fat fries, biscuits) and weren‚Äôt disappointed. Cocktails were refreshing too, particularly ‚Äúin to the wild,‚Äù similar to a cherry limeade, and the mocktail, veto mango fizz.
They do *not* offer a military discount. They have a parking lot and street parking. We‚Äôll be back again and bringing friends!",2024-08-10,5,Salty Sow,"1917 Manor Rd, Austin, TX 78722, USA",0.923,Positive
"The appetizers were my favorite. I'm torn between the truffled deviled eggs and duck fat fries. The biscuit has the best airy butter too. For the main we got pork belly tips with cheese grits that had a great flavor. We sat outside with our dog and they were all so sweet to her.
And they had some great wine options too.",2024-08-31,5,Salty Sow,"1917 Manor Rd, Austin, TX 78722, USA",0.9491,Positive
Y'all this food is delicious! I've been going to Salty Sow for years and it never disappoints. Everything tastes so good and is consistently one of the best meals I've ever had in Austin.

They even managed to still have decent presentation with sustainable packaging for delivery.,2024-07-23,5,Salty Sow,"1917 Manor Rd, Austin, TX 78722, USA",0.959,Positive
"The redfish is especially good, enough to justify a double serving! . Everything came with hearty portions and was very flavourful. The sides, especially the Brussels stood out. For starters the French fries and the chicken pate were excellent, and the main courses paired very well with the biscuits. The atmosphere was warm and welcoming, much like the food.",2024-08-16,5,Salty Sow,"1917 Manor Rd, Austin, TX 78722, USA",0.9421,Positive
"Salty Sow is a really nice place with a beautiful decor, that make you feel super relaxed. We went during happy hour, and it was crowded with people constantly coming in, which is a great sign. We didn't have to wait long to be seated, and once we were, the service was friendly and super quick.

Happy hour dishes were really tasty, though the portions were a bit small. Overall, it was a good experience!",2024-03-26,5,Salty Sow,"1917 Manor Rd, Austin, TX 78722, USA",0.989,Positive
"Violet Crown Cinema is an iconic and unique escape in downtown Austin, offering a clean and cozy atmosphere perfect for quality films.

"It's been a while since I've been here, but I went last night. Good drink selection. Used to have better soft drinks. Now it's just Coke products. Boo. Pizza is new, and that's nice. Good theatre set-up. Very modern, but somewhat spartan. I'm okay with that. They show more interesting films than mainstream theatres.",2024-09-25,5,Violet Crown Cinema,"434 W 2nd St, Austin, TX 78701, USA",0.969,Positive
A cool and funky small theater in west downtown near a bunch of good restaurants. They tend to have a good selection of eclectic films and it is generally not busy during the day on weekdays.

Always a treat.",2023-07-08,5,Violet Crown Cinema,"434 W 2nd St, Austin, TX 78701, USA",0.969,Positive
"Great venue for those interested in independent movies. An amazing modern and cozy environment, their food is great and have a good selection of wine, beer and cocktails.

"This place has an authentic Austin feel, mix of western and modern. The staff is very friendly and professional. The food is all great, haven't had a dish I didn't like. We had the queso, hanger steak, and beef brisket. All very juicy and full of flavor. The drinks are good too - not a bunch of crushed ice, you actually get alcohol! They have live music upstairs.",2024-09-26,5,Lamberts,"401 W 2nd St, Austin, TX 78701, USA",0.9002,Positive
"I enjoyyyyedd so much going to Lamberts for my first meal in Austin. I found the place a little bit by chance and I was highly satisfied by the service. I was taken care of by Will. I loved his energy and professionalism. Food was also great: I had the 3 meats plate. It was heavy - as expected :) I also had an Old Fashion, that I liked very much. Would definitely recommend !",2024-08-28,5,Lamberts,"401 W 2nd St, Austin, TX 78701, USA",0.9812,Positive
"I loved Lamberts' lunch of brisket sandwich and cashew lime coleslaw. Each of the few ingredients of the sandwich are harmonies without seeming overwrought. Both their red and mustard sauces are an excellent compliment to their brisket without insisting on themselves.
After Lamberts it's fun to visit Toy Joy to shop, Joe's for coffee, or the riverside trail to walk off your meal.",2024-09-08,5,Lamberts,"401 W 2nd St, Austin, TX 78701, USA",0.9643,Positive

Miami friends recommended and, boy, were they right!

Amazing brisket and Mac and cheese.

Highly recommend!",2024-09-17,5,Lamberts,"401 W 2nd St, Austin, TX 78701, USA",0.9516,Positive
"Lamberts is a great barbecue place if you are in the area. The crispy wild boar ribs we'r6e very flavorful and had somewhat of an Asian influence. I would definitely highly recommend this appetizer to start with. I had the two meat plate which I would say is good. The brisket was lean, meaty, and somewhat tender. If you're looking for extra moist brisket, this is not it. However, the flavor was good and the sides that I got were collard, greens and coleslaw. Both of these sides were not bad.

I really enjoyed that. The table came with three different sauces. My favorite probably was the mustard and then the hot and then the house. I saw some of my co-workers really lather their barbecue with the house sauce so that might say something about it. It was a little bit vinegary for me, however that's not a bad thing.

I would say that if you're in the area and craving BBQ, this is not a bad place to go. With me living up north I would not make a specific trip to come here as it would be a little bit out of my way.",2024-04-12,4,Lamberts,"401 W 2nd St, Austin, TX 78701, USA",0.972,Positive
"VIBE check and it‚Äôs perfect.. happy, eclectic, full house and the best salsa .. the food was good. I loved the service, they were kind enough to suggest great vegetarian options.

"We knew about Uchi because it's supposed to be the best restaurant in Austin. A special occasion came up, so we visited on a Saturday night. I am pleased to report it blew us away. It's rare to have an eating experience unlike any you've had before. The dishes were perfectly prepared - particularly the sauces. What stood out most to me were the flavors: exquisitely crafted and balanced. I'm not a big raw fish fan, but I enjoyed everything I ate. The service was also quite good. We mentioned our special occasion and the server brought us a really good trout dish on the house. Complimentary valet parking was nice too.

"Always a complete pleasure eating here.   Service and atmosphere are as expected.   The food never disappoints.   My cold sake was creamy and refreshing.   The wagyu carpacio is delicious!!  I tried all three of the market selection and all 3 were amazing.   The grilled fish appetizer is stupid good,  with perfect texture and flavor.   The scallop bites are always super fresh and bright.  The tuna hand roll bursts with flavor.   The Cesar hand roll is so underrated,  so delicious.

"I‚Äôm not from Austin and almost everyone I asked for restaurant recommendations suggested this place. I wasn‚Äôt really sure what to expect so I went for happy hour to catch the vibe. Ended up ordering maybe 15 dishes. Incredible quality. Don‚Äôt think I‚Äôve had sashimi this good anywhere but costal towns.

Our server Yumi was an absolute angel. Impeccable menu knowledge. Gave us great recommendations. Give this girl a raise. She truly made our experience.

Absolutely suggest the wagyu carpaccio and  all the nigiri and sashimi we had SLAPPPEDDD.

"Was looking for an impromptu brunch spot with my mom and sister and stumbled across this place. SUPERB!!! HIGHLY RECOMMEND!  Our server, Soner, was friendly, funny, and fast. He engaged in conversation with us just enough - not pushy or rushed at all. The food was excellent. Great variety of flavors (we each ordered something different so we could try the most). The atmosphere was bright with plenty of space between tables. It's casual enough that you can dress up or down. We came casual but saw plenty of groups dressed up & celebrating.

"The food was amazing it was so filling and the price was right!! The service was amazing!!
I'm giving a 4 for atmosphere and overall a 4 because of the smoke inside. The inside was so smokey from the cooking that we had to go outside and eat.

"Really nice Italian Submarine Sandwich. Ultra-thinly sliced iceberg lettuce. Excellent bread with lots of delicately nutty crunchy toasted sesame seeds on top. Hot pickled cherry peppers are spot on. I‚Äôll ask for a little less mayo next time. Got a large sub cut in half which made for 2 nice full meals, taking the other half home. The large is a really huge sandwich just like it‚Äôs supposed to be. Other places like Grata‚Äôs pizzeria and a few others can run pretty small. All in all HomeSlice has by far the best Italian Sub in South Austin. Staff is super friendly and welcoming to everyone. Blair was awesome with all the right recommendations. Music and vibe are great. Parking all up and down the street.

I was in the are visiting my father (I'm from Colorado), and while we were looking for a place to eat, I decided to look up some of the best pizza spots in Austin. This place was only 4 minutes away from us and had EXCELLENT reviews.
They really hit it out of the park for us! Pizza and salad were both insanely good! I'm someone who likes to try new places every time, but I can't help but feel that I'll give in and return here next time I'm craving a great pizza.

The pizza featured a rich red sauce that perfectly complemented the unique taste of the eggplant. The flavors were well-balanced, and the ingredients tasted fresh and high-quality. The crust was just right ‚Äì crispy on the outside and soft on the inside.

O got the egg added to mine and it was cooked so long it was rubbery and had to remove it to finish my burger. The Fries were also very tough and rubbery, it literally broke my denture trying to bite a piece off. The shake was luke warm and very runny. The shake didn‚Äôt taste bad just warm. $40 for two people to eat and not very good food. I wouldn‚Äôt recommend going and we will not go again.

The margaritas were great, we ordered the mangorita and the pineapple margaritas. The Mango one was like a slushy and really yummy. In the other one though you could hardly taste the pineapple and could strongly taste the alcohol. The salsa they have is so fresh and flavourful! Queso was mid. I really like the enchiladas, we ordered the medium spice level vegetarian sauce.
I understand it was a busy day, but still the service could be a little better. Our waitress did seem a little flighty and there were a couple of instances where she just tossed a bowl of salsa on to the table and disappeared and we couldn‚Äôt ask for things like cutlery etc.

All in all, would definitely go again maybe on a not so busy day.",2024-08-09,5,Chuy's,"1728 Barton Springs Rd, Austin, TX 78704, USA",0.9717,Positive

It had a soapy taste to it.  I did tell the server, and she replaced it,  but it still had a horrible taste.   Everyone enjoyed their food,  but my friends (who've never had mussels) and my daughter RAVED about the mussels.   They were ABSOLUTELY delicious.

"Clay Pit: Good Kebabs, Frustrating Service, Disappointing Drinks

I recently visited Clay Pit Contemporary Indian Cuisine in Austin, TX, prior to the Tim McGraw concert, eager to relive some of the incredible flavors I experienced traveling throughout India. The kebabs and curry did not disappoint. The Tandoori Kebabs were perfectly cooked and bursting with flavor, a true taste of tradition.

However, the service left a lot to be desired. We had a 5:00 pm reservation for three, but upon arrival, we were informed they wouldn't seat us until our entire party was present.  Our daughter, who had just arrived on an international flight, was stuck in traffic 15 minutes away.  While the restaurant wasn't packed, with only six other patrons and several empty tables, they were unwilling to accommodate us for seating. This inflexibility was frustrating, especially considering our extenuating circumstances.

The food, as mentioned, Tandoori Kebabs were good.  However, skip the cocktails. My ""Indian Nights"" drink was a major letdown. It was watery and barely tasted of gin, a far cry from the photo on the menu.

Overall, Clay Pit is a mixed bag. The food is good, but the service needs improvement, and the cocktails are a definite miss and avoid. While I wouldn't recommend it wholeheartedly or plan to return myself, if you're looking for an Indian food experience in Austin and prioritize the food over everything else, it might be worth a try. Just be prepared for a potentially inflexible seating policy and underwhelming drinks.",2024-06-04,3,Clay Pit Contemporary Indian Cuisine,"1601 Guadalupe St, Austin, TX 78701, USA",0.8744,Positive
"Good place to try if you are craving north-Indian food near the campus. The taste was more westernized, than truly authentic. Portion size of curries & meat were fairly small compared to the amount of basmati rice. The place was spacious, clean and service was quick.

Stick to the main course because you‚Äôll upset when you don‚Äôt finish your entree. I got the chicken fajita queso enchiladas, and that was a waste of time. The rice was bland, and the charro beans managed to be blander. Why did I give Trudy‚Äôs 4 stars for such a description? I nibbled off some of my buddy‚Äôs meal.

"Went to Banger's for the first time while visiting Austin Texas. Great place. Menu was accessible through a QR code. Had an excellent selection of beers. Great BBQ. The apps and food were both excellent. We ordered the crispy fried pickles and cheese curds as appetizers. And got the pulled pork sandwich for the main entre. Very good. Came with pickles, Cole slaw, and purple picked cabbage. They even had a stage outside and a live band playing while we were
there. Very cool place. Would recommend.",2024-08-09,5,Banger's Sausage House & Beer Garden,"79 Rainey St, Austin, TX 78701, USA",0.9814,Positive
"Great place on Rainey Street! Big outdoor area. You can get BBQ, small bites, sandwiches.  Inside is nice on a hot night(it was super hot this August...thank good for a good air conditioned indoors!)  but the outdoor patio is epic. Really good to meet up with a bunch of friends.

The food was really tasty! The deviled eggs were yummy, the chicken salad has great flavor (tarragon) and it's nice fresh chicken.  Perfect small bites for having a couple beers .

Speaking of beers ...I think there was like 70 or 80 some odd taps! If you can't find something to try here ... well..... you're lost! LOL.  If you are not beer person , they have a couple wine choices , or try a lambic!

Service here is excellent. Friendly, fast, and genuine . Their kitchen had a problem the day we were there, and no one let it change their attitude.  Thanks to Reese (Rhys?) for great service.  We really enjoyed our evening here.",2024-08-25,5,Banger's Sausage House & Beer Garden,"79 Rainey St, Austin, TX 78701, USA",0.9961,Positive
"Went here for our anniversary and our experience was amazing! To start off, the hostesses greeted us with the sweetest smile and even congratulated  us on our anniversary. We were then walked upstairs to the second floor and were again greeted by the restaurant manager who was very kind and welcoming and he also congratulated us. He was so attentive and just amazing overall. Our table was decorated with rose petals and a ‚ÄúHappy Anniversary‚Äù sign which was the sweetest touch! One waiter came with our drinks and he was a gem, whom, of course also congratulated us! Our waiter Colin, was absolutely amazing. He made us feel welcome! He always checked up on us, he described the items on the menu which such detail, he was just overall very kind! Colin brought us a dessert for our anniversary and it was such a great way to end the night.

"Truluck's Downtown in Austin is hands down my favorite restaurant, and my recent birthday celebration there with five friends only reaffirmed this. From the moment we walked in, the experience was nothing short of spectacular.

The ambiance of Truluck's is refined and welcoming, setting the perfect tone for a special evening. We were warmly greeted and promptly seated, instantly feeling like valued guests. The service throughout the night was impeccable ‚Äì attentive, friendly, and professional, ensuring that every detail was taken care of with a smile.

The food was phenomenal. Every dish we ordered was cooked to perfection and beautifully presented. The flavors were exquisite, and the quality of the ingredients was evident in every bite. The seafood, in particular, was outstanding, fresh, and delicious. Coupled with expertly crafted cocktails and a well-curated wine list, our dining experience was elevated to new heights.

Parking, often a hassle in downtown areas, was surprisingly convenient at Truluck's. It made arriving and leaving the restaurant stress-free, allowing us to focus entirely on enjoying our evening.

To anyone seeking a top-notch dining experience in Austin, I can't recommend Truluck's Downtown enough. Whether it's for a special occasion or simply to enjoy an excellent meal, this restaurant delivers on every front ‚Äì food, drinks, service, and ambiance. My birthday celebration was truly memorable, and I look forward to many more delightful evenings at Truluck's.

"This was our first time at Truluck‚Äôs; it was a great first experience. Our server (Niko) was new but he was great. He was attentive, engaging, and polite; his suggestion for how to construct our seafood tower appetizer was spot on. The appetizers satisfied my seafood craving, so I went with a NY strip for dinner; it was cooked perfectly . My wife had the Branzino fish (also recommended by our server), it too was good. The sides (truffle fries and roasted broccoli were nice compliments. This isn‚Äôt a place you‚Äôd frequent often (it‚Äôs not cheap), but I can‚Äôt think of a better place to satisfy a seafood craving. üëçüèªüëçüèª",2024-07-07,5,Truluck's Ocean's Finest Seafood & Crab,"300 Colorado St, Austin, TX 78701, USA",0.9923,Positive
"Amazing experience from the minute you pull up to the valet. The host staff was friendly and engaging.  They took us up to a beautiful patio. Table fans and misters made eating outside delightful and very comfortable. The light up menus were fantastic. If you are visiting on the weekend, ask for Bradley.  We let Bradley guide us through the menu. We started with a Terlan Pinot Grigio, N/A Berry Patch, and a Viola. Truly perfect picks! We started with the Ahi Tuna Tartare and Jumbo Lump Crab Cake. Both were exceptional. I switched to Bradley's other suggested cocktail Tru Story.  So yummy!  After Bradley's highlighting of the menu we wanted to try it all so we chose to order the Petit Miso Glazed Seabass and the Petit Scallop & Shrimp Saute and  the 1/2 lbs of King Crab and the side of Mac & Cheese.  The Seabass was phenomenal. The Crab Fried Rice is sensational. The 2 paired together is off the hook. The scallops were amazing, and if you were served the Florentino cauliflower ""rice"" without being told it was cauliflower, you would never guess. It is so flavorful. The King Crab was great and served with mashed potatoes and asparagus. As we were sharing all the dishes, we only had room for one bite of Mac and cheese before packing it up to go, but we're so glad we ordered it as it was excellent as well. The service was top-notch and friendly without being overbearing. The manager welcomed us and checked in throughout our meal, and although we had no issues, I am confident that if even the smallest glitch were to happen, he would be aware and address it immediately. He really made us feel like he cared about our
experience. That is very rare these days. We are huge foodies, and eating great food is our hobby. With the attention to detail Truluck at every turn, the price paid for the meal was an exceptional value!

"My wife and I visited Kerbey Lane for breakfast. I ordered a Harvest Omelet, comprised of 3 eggs,  cheddar jack cheese, green onions,  green pepper,  onion,  sliced mushroom and avocado. I chose, for my 2 sides,  an English muffin and seasoned home fries. My wife had an Avocado Toast, made up of hummus, sliced avocado, cucumbers and a sunny side up egg garnished with cherry tomatoes and green onion.  My wife chose black beans as her side.

The Harvest Omelet was very tasty as was the english muffin. Sadly,  the home fries were overcooked and dry, more reflective of boxed home fries than of fresh home fries.

My wife's Avocado Toast delivered,  with great flavor. The big surprise were the black beans,  which had a well- balanced mild hint of garlic and a slight well- received chili- like kick.

The atmosphere is spacious and appropriately bright.  The service was average.

I consider Kerbey Lane to be a reliable breakfast/brunch restaurant,  but if our sole visit is any indication,  I can't say we'll choose it before trying another restaurant for the first time.",2024-05-18,3,Kerbey Lane Cafe - University,"2606 Guadalupe St, Austin, TX 78705, USA",0.8201,Positive

We finally could get a feel of what the fuss was all about this famous brunch place. The coffee was freshly brewed and the food was fantastic.

"Apr2024: 4‚≠ê: I could recommend this location and the restaurant BBQ meat.
I stopped by this location during the lunch hour to pick up some lunch time BBQ. I observed customers seated throughout the restaurant eating lunch when I visited. There appears to be limited seating at this location as observed. I ordered chicken, beef, and pork ribs to go. I noted that I was given only one set of plastic utensils for a large order to go. It's a good thing I noticed and grabbed some needed utensils on my way out of the restaurant. My order came with fries and the worker pointed to some that were warming. The fries were not worthy of more than three ‚≠ê. I threw more than half of them away because they were hard and stale. The beef was sliced when I ordered it for my sandwich. It was wrapped and prepared. The half chicken and pork ribs that I ordered were wrapped in paper as well. I sampled all of the meats and it was well prepared and cooked to taste.  The parking in this area is not good. I would not want to drive to this location and have to pay an exorbitant amount to find a parking location.",2024-04-26,4,Iron Works Barbecue,"100 Red River St, Austin, TX 78701, USA",0.8258,Positive
"This was my second time coming to Iron Works Barbecue; first visit was unremarkable/had no complaints. As a frequent out of town visitor, I do appreciate how close/convenient it is to my hotel.

The turkey sandwich was 7/10. It was a little slim on meat compared to the amount of bun. The turkey was Smokey but the outside crust was a little too pepper heavy for my liking. I would come back but try something else next time.

I was mostly put off by the customer service experience I had during this visit from someone named Marie. Marie took my order in the kitchen window.. & she must be having a pretty crap day to treat a customer the way she treated me. When I approached and said hello she didn‚Äôt reply or reciprocate - that‚Äôs fine. When I asked a question about a sandwich she was instantly annoyed in both tone and body language. When I asked where to get some sauce she said ‚Äúif I would give her a minute‚Äù she would be packing it into my bag. It wasn‚Äôt  even busy so I was confused as to why she was so frustrated with my existence.

When I got my sandwich - there was no BBQ sauce (even tho I asked previously). I returned and asked for a few. She questioned whether I even looked and I opened the box to show her. She said nothing else and slid one across the counter and walked away from me‚Ä¶ When I please asked for one more cup she stomped back to the window and actually *tossed it at me*! I was lucky it didn‚Äôt break open all over my shirt.

The whole thing was a bit shocking and for an adult ? I think she might need a minor lesson in mutual respect.",2024-09-26,3,Iron Works Barbecue,"100 Red River St, Austin, TX 78701, USA",-0.1677,Negative
Iron Works never fails at the taste of some good Texas Barbecue so much that celebrities and other high end go and stop and eat there. Who knows maybe one day you can acutally come across someone that is being introduced to Texas Barbecue. The brisket beef is a MUST! And I think it‚Äôs one of their most signature plates out there. Of course there is other options available to you if you want other meats but some authentic Texas Barbecue is brisket beef! Of course during the summer get ready to pick up some sweat as it will get hot from your surroundings. Overall I do recommend eating here! So enjoy it!

"A phenomenal dinner experience, from start to finish. Having read reviews and receiving recommendations from others, I was expecting a good experience but it definitely surpassed my expectations.

We used the valet parking which is the garage in the same block, it was $15 and very quick and easy.

Our service was impeccable, from our hostess and especially our waiter Sam, to others who checked on us through the experience to make sure we were well taken care of.  Sam was the perfect level of attentiveness without being overbearing, with very spot-on recommendations for both food and drinks.

They do an amazing job making you feel valued and special and I believe everyone that we interacted with knew that we were celebrating an anniversary and wished us well, which was very touching.

For appetizers, we had the chicken fried lobster which was phenomenal. It came with a tomato butter, which I personally am not a fan of tomatoes, but it was light and not overpowering, and my partner especially loved the leftovers on the delicious bread. We also had the off menu bone marrow which came with delicious toast like bread in a very generous amount.

For dinner, we had a classic eye of ribeye pepper steak medium rare, with the Oscar style top of crab, Hollandaise sauce and asparagus. The sauce and the Oscar style toppings were phenomenal, and the steak perfectly cooked. I had them served on the side and both were so amazing that I couldn‚Äôt tell you which was better, and I could probably eat the Oscar style as a whole dish honestly!

We also had the truffled mushroom burger with the king sauce, another amazing recommendation.  Very rich and also perfectly cooked to medium rare.

We got the fried Thai chili brussels sprouts, as well as the six cheese potatoes, for sides. The sprouts were very flavorful and had a perfect crunch. The potatoes were good but I felt a little bit bland compared to the other dishes, and could have used some additional salt.

They brought us a surprise for dessert, which included the chocolate and Texas pecan cake. One of the best parts of the meal was probably the homemade bootleg Irish cream, which was very thick and creamy and had hints of coconut as well as I felt banana. Definitely a reason to come back for my birthday dinner, ha ha!

For two people, it was a ton of food and we left very full and satisfied and have leftovers for dinner the next night.

Overall it was an exceptional experience from the moment we walked in until the moment we drove away. A wonderful date night or special occasion place for us to visit again in the future",2024-06-25,5,III Forks,"111 Lavaca St, Austin, TX 78701, USA",0.9994,Positive

"Wow this place is so different because it's on the side of a highway, looks like an old liquor store and serves Indian food with epic paintings of Ganesh on the side patio and on the inside you feel like you're in an old musty pub. Need I say more? Have I completely sold this place!? Good, come with me on my fantastic Whip in adventure.

It wasn't my idea to come here, it was my friends because I have genius friends. They were always intrigued by the strange looking Whip In sign off the side of the highway, beconing people to try their Indian food. Who wouldn't be intrigued? So we arrived, ordered some beers (they have a wide variety!) and sat outside on the patio. I'm kicking myself now for not taking some great pictures of Ganesh - next time.

After a while we decide to order some food and settle on:

paneer tikka - quite nice, it comes with a sauce and lime which compliments the flavour
bhindi masala - mild with nice flavor. I didn't get the slimy texture I usually get with okra which was a plus
spicy paneer tikka masal - I liked this one because it was creamy with a good amount of heat
dosa- the dosa came with sauce and a daal and was packed full of potato and veggies
naan - yum!

My favorite is absolutely the grilled cheese with spicy honey OMG to die for!! The experience is definitely worth it and the staff is friendly and amazing explains everything. The manager was out helping the staff. I loved the bar with salads. I left so full. Was way worth it. 20 out of 10 will be returning and must try everything!

The salad bar is extraordinary with a huge selection of goodies. Including bacon which they leave unguarded. The cheese bread is very tasty. The meats were all scrumptious especially the Parmesan Chicken. You really can't go wrong with any of the meats.

"Service sucked. Food was okay was tolerable but the service just terrible. Had to ask for chips, had to ask for straw, drinks was not refilled guess what had to ask for that too. My neighbors got what they needed when they were low on chips, drinks etc. I had to ask for chips refilled, salsa and the check. Kind of embarrassing cause I‚Äôm bragging about my wife about this place. It was a little busy but not enough for service to suck. They had a lot of servers. I am also in service industry and I am patient but it was just not good. Will not be back and will not recommend. I will get better service at my local taqueria.

First time here while in Austin. I would like to rate the food as an A+. I don't really need to explain much but the Don Juan Taco is gigantic and delicious. I also tried an enchilada and taco and I was not disappointed. There really is isn't anything bad to say about this place. The food is amazing. The wait time was not too long either about 10 min.

"I have dined here twice while working out of town and it's a great place! It's set in the beautiful Hyatt Regency, right on the river! The bar has been clean both times I went and the service great!

My first visit, I ordered the Capital Burger, which consists of Grass-Fed Beef*, White Cheddar, Green Leaf Lettuce, Tomato, Red Onion, Pickles, and a Brioche bun and of course I added bacon! The burger was thick and juicy, perfectly cooked with some nice bacon strips, and the fries were great, crunchy on the outside soft on the inside!

My second visit I ordered the Halibut which consists of Pan Seared Halibut, Fennel Pollen, Spinach & Exotic Mushrooms, Nduja Jasmine Rice! The fish was seared to perfection, the veggies and rice were so nice and fresh! Once I ordered it about 5 other folks got it because it looked and smelled so good!

Drinks are nice and strong and there is a wide variety of them. All in all, it's a great place to grab a bite, and a drink with a beautiful backdrop of the river.",2023-12-13,5,Marker 10 Spirits & Cuisine,"208 Barton Springs Rd, Austin, TX 78704, USA",0.9951,Positive

"I ordered two crispy beef tacos with rice and beans. We had an appetizer of chips and salsa. The chips arrived and were straight out of a bag, cold, not freshly made. Half of it was smashed into bits - bottom of the bag! We returned it for a refund. Next, the taco shells were straight from a box, not freshly fried. The ground beef had no flavor except for salt. I pulled a chunk of ground beef out that was raw on the inside. I was scared to eat the rice after this. The worst Mexican food I have ever eaten! They should be ashamed to serve it but apparently the joke is on us. After I stood up, a group of pigeons dived bombed on my plate and apparently enjoyed the plate very much.

"We went to eat at pluckers as we normally do.. normally everything is very delicious of course we usually go in the afternoons this time we decided to go for lunch.. it is worth mentioning that we are frequent customers at this location in Rio Grande, this time we ordered the appetizers and After 5 minutes they asked us if we were ready to order the food and we said yes although we still didn't have our apetazier... half an hour later the cold appetizers arrived completely cold, some of the fries were hard and difficult to eat... after 5 minutes the food arrived. Food also cold.. but I only told the waitress that our appetizers were cold.. then we ordered a brownie that came almost frozen and on this occasion I decided to ask to speak to the manager.. (a short girl who wears a red shirt).. she cameto our table ; I told her about the brownie with the fries and she offered to reheat the brownie... I told her no thanks and she insisted a lot and took it away ; but she came back with another different brownie cut in half too thin... my children started to eat. eat it but I suggested that they not do it since.  It looked a little strange.. anyway.. the manager returned to the table (with a somewhat abrupt attitude when she asking), obviously you could see the discontent in her attitude when she asking if we liked the Brownie.. I responded that I didn't even dare to touch the brownie ; ...and she ignored me... I don't know why she ask if I liked it;  perhaps by inertia?  Anyway, this location deserves a better manager or better staff... maybe training?  .. we have more than 10,000 points accumulated in the pluckers application .. and this location is the closest to our department, it is sad to have to go to other locations further away to receive good service, some warm wings, and a brownie At least well heated in the microwave... the next time I see one of the founders of pluckers I'll make the comment... it's a shame I've only seen them in that location.
(I forgot to mention that we piled up the plates near the edge of the table before ordering the brownie and neither the waitress nor the manager removed them. Remember that the manager was at the table three times and all 3 times the stack of plates was there... and never She bothered to remove them. I insist on thet should returning to training.  especially her and her staff in the kitchen.)",2024-03-03,1,Pluckers Wing Bar,"2222 Rio Grande St Ste D116, Austin, TX 78705, USA",0.9552,Positive

To make matters worse, we were told at 10:20ish that they were already closing soon, and our food would be ready shortly. However, 40 minutes passed without any sign of our order. Frustrated, we had no choice but to leave without eating. I've had good experiences here before, but this visit was a major letdown.

"Elizabeth Street Cafe is a culinary gem that left me thoroughly impressed. The appetizers set the tone for an exceptional meal, with the poached shrimp spring rolls offering a fresh start and the pork belly buns stealing the show with their unbelievably soft texture. The main courses were equally delightful, featuring a perfect pairing of Singapore noodles and red curry noodles that offered contrasting yet complementary experiences - the former a satisfying dry noodle dish, while the latter consisted of a comforting brothy soup. The restaurant's attention to detail extends beyond the food, with craft cocktails that are as visually stunning as they are delicious. The quick and friendly service enhanced the overall experience, and the charming, fun decor created a delightful ambience.

(We are avid foodies.) Once we understood that they recommend sharing plates (and they explained the ingredients), we got several plates. We really enjoyed it all and had great service.

We were fortunate to have Sarah as our main server, and she was fantastic. Kira also helped out and was equally amazing. Fern, the bartender, crafted some of the best drinks we've had, and Curtis, the general manager, ensured everything ran smoothly. The front-of-house team, which had about five members, was exceptional. We were helped by every single team member multiple times.

"My mother was visiting me for the first time after moving to Austin and I wanted to take her somewhere nice for lunch. Since I'm gluten free, we planned which day we would go based on the weekly menu that's published for the buffet. There isn't the quantity of food that we'd typically see at a Vegas buffet, but the price, quality and presentation of the food more than made up for it. We ate until we couldn't eat any more, the staff was very friendly, and the signs clearly posted which items were gluten free. I believe there's no parking validation for lunchtime but overall it's still cheaper than going to Vegas to meet for a buffet lunch.",2023-09-07,5,The Carillon,"1900 University Ave, Austin, TX 78705, USA",0.9324,Positive
"Beautiful atmosphere so we were surprised it was mostly empty for a brunch buffet.  Especially at a reasonably price as it is.  Beautiful room and furnishings.  Lovely.

Lovely mimosas, good coffee. A rather sparse buffet of oatmeal, pancakes, scrambled eggs only (not other options), sausage, bacon, potatoes, and premade processed Sysco-style breads for toasting, plain fruit.  No desserts or omelettes or anything such as that but that would have been great for me...had the bacon not been literally rancid and the bagels horribly stale.

We all noticed the issue with the bacon but I was quite sure they were aware of it, because of the issue with the bagels.  I grabbed one and it was so hard, so stale, that I said out loud, without realizing it ""Oh my God, these are horribly stale!"" We were there right when they opened so they had clearly reused them, rather than them being out all day.

Fortunately, a staff member did hear me and asked if I would like a fresh one.  She got out the bag to assist me which was very kind.  She likely replaced them after that.

The eggs were good, though not hot,  and the potatoes were as well.  The items are not served in chafing dishes which may be the cause of the spoiled bacon if they reused it from the day before, or God forbid now that I think about it, last week.  It wasn't a question or a maybe, the bacon had gone bad.  And it was evident.  All food is in cast iron pans, not chafers to keep the food fresh and at controlled temperatures.

Initially our service was great but we waited for 40 minutes after finishing to get our bill.  No refills, no  check-ins.  ( We did have both initially but then all staff were absent and we could not leave.). My first old plate sat under a new one because there was no service to remove it.  By 11:30, we wandered around the empty restaurant looking for anyone to help us so that we could leave, as two of us had rides waiting.  We could not find our waitress still but were assisted by another waiter who went to find her.  It was totally empty by that time.

I would rather pay double for fresh food and some thought of the offerings, such as an eggs benedict or an omelette station or some fresh pastries or desserts or some interesting other offerings like perhaps migas....it was so plain, so simple, and sadly 2 items being reused when they were VERY bad, that we would not return.

I take that back, I would try cocktails here in the evening, because we love the atmosphere, but brunch is empty for good reason so each of our table of 8 would need to decline that option.",2024-01-29,2,The Carillon,"1900 University Ave, Austin, TX 78705, USA",0.9917,Positive

Personally, I love their BBQ chicken with a frozen margarita and chips - forward by a walk across the street for a beer at the Mean Eyed Cat. That's a great Austin experience.",2024-09-23,5,El Arroyo,"1624 W 5th St, Austin, TX 78703, USA",0.9702,Positive
"Finally came in for lunch, I pass by El Arroyo often working in Austin. Very cool Austin original and the sign is obviously famous around the internet for its trendy statements.

Definitely a place to mark off my bucket list‚Ä¶‚Ä¶I got the fried avocado ü•ë plate, Trudy‚Äôs is famous for the stuffed avocado but El Arroyo has it too!

Too bad I was working and couldn‚Äôt enjoy some beer and margaritas!!! Maybe next time.",2024-08-21,5,El Arroyo,"1624 W 5th St, Austin, TX 78703, USA",0.6305,Positive
"Nostalgia, history, and these darn tootin creative signs that change regularly with spontaneous comedic text, this place has made a name for itself in memes across the internet and in the hearts of Austin.

Got the queso and a shrimp and crab cream cheese enchilada was pretty delicious. Actually tasted a bit like crab dip, which actually seemed about right after rereading the description on the menu.  I don't know that I would order that again because it's a lot of the same taste, but it was good.  Perhaps if one we're sharing that and something else it would be good to mix and match.  That said, the plate was big enough to share between two. Lots of rice and beans, and two big enchiladas.

The design of the place is pretty cool. They have a cut apart school bus outside that is pretty neat.  With Fun artistic design of the place in general.  There is both indoor and outdoor seating. The outdoors probably more artistic, but ended up sitting inside because it was hot out.

You can also kind of gift shop Christmas ornaments, magnets, etc, of the oh so famous the sign.  The ornaments were about $20 in September of 2024.",2024-09-18,5,El Arroyo,"1624 W 5th St, Austin, TX 78703, USA",0.9923,Positive
"Seat yourself when you walk in. Food is AMAZING. Great flavor all around. They don‚Äôt have fountain drinks, they are cans. So just be prepared for that.
This was our first time and we will definitely be back.
There is indoor and outdoor seating.
Went around 4:50 on a Sunday and was in and out within an hour.

Seriously can‚Äôt get over how delicious my meal was. I got the Santa Fe enchiladas with sour cream sauce. TO DIE FOR. That flavor is not comparable.

BBQ chicken I wasn‚Äôt sold on until I tasted it. Oh my goodness it‚Äôs delicious!

You really can‚Äôt go wrong with anything you choose.

12/10 recommend.

"Lovely place with really attentive and entertaining staff. Unfortunately I just really think the menu is not all that good. When they bring out tortillas they're incredibly hard and difficult... most of the food is just not convenient to eat and the flavors are not all that great. If you're going to do family style make it convenient to portion. Ceviche was not that great either. I get that they are doing their own take on traditional dishes but I just don't think their take is neither tasty nor convenient in the way they prepare and serve it. The flavors are also uninspiring, some more than others. The guacamole was just guacamole but quite expensive, this seem to be the recurring theme. The dishes were the some of their parts but there was nothing transcendent in terms of flavor about any of it. And this is a shame because Mexican food really can be done in an upscale way and be amazing. Just not this chef.",2024-09-02,3,La Condesa,"400 W 2nd St A, Austin, TX 78701, USA",-0.131,Negative
"This was our first time at La Condesa.  We went about 5:00 p.m. for happy hour only.

We parked in a nearby parking garage, as street parking downtown can be difficult.

We sat in the bar area and easily found two seats. It was a nice setting.

The service was excellent!! And the happy hour special was excellent also!

My key fob fell onto the floor while there, and they were already closed for the night before I realized it. They held it for me until I could get back to town a couple of days later, and quickly got it when we came in for it.

We had great service and food was delicious! Even though portions were not big, food was still filling and satisfying. Warm churros were a perfect way to end our dinner.",2024-05-21,4,La Condesa,"400 W 2nd St A, Austin, TX 78701, USA",0.9849,Positive

There‚Äôs a parking garage right beside the restaurant on Guadalupe street. The happy hour menu is amazing. Half off the entire list of drinks. Must sit in the bar area for the happy hour. More seating in the area than pictured, including a small patio. They have some amazing tequila options. We couldn‚Äôt believe the complexity and flavor of the El Cubico.

"April 2024

Hoover's Cooking is all about serving the local community with southern comfort food much of which is locally sourced. I have dined here before a few times in the past and was excited to return.  It is located in an area full of new popular eateries, but this place is a landmark. There was plenty of parking and was easy to find. It is all table seating except a few booths.

I noticed the staff took their time to seat and serve you. No rushing which made me feel more like being at my parents. It was very calm.  I also noticed the ""Love Rocks TX."" slogan all over with a huge collection of painted rocks to spread love which remind when I myself painted a rock during Covid. There was a charm about this place watching an older man painting away.

I ordered the 2PC Fried Chicken Dark with 2 House Mates, Macaroni & Cheese and Green Beans, and Sweet Tea. From looking around this place it displays local Austin history all around including items from the Frisco Shop. Once our heavy plates of food arrived the fried chicken looked very good. The food was very hot.  I tried a chicken leg and the crust was crunchy and tasty.  The chicken was also very delicious. The mac & cheese was great along with the green beans which had chunks of brisket in it. Overall it was really good where it was not spicy at all and perfect for older folks. Really good fried chicken.

Service was about as bad as it gets. The server was rude and blatantly unfriendly. When taking our order rather than explaining what we could get with our chilaquiles he turned his screen around and made us read through the options on his pos system.

"We went to Casa de Luz last night and it was the cutest place. Everything was fantastic! The problem is my 3 year old and I shared my platter and both of us ended up getting food poisoning later that night. The one thing I remember consuming that tasted completely off was the avocado. It tasted like straight up rotten avocado but I dished up my kid‚Äôs food before trying everything. By then my child had consumed her entire avocado portion I gave her. We had come here with my sister and her family and our family friend. I asked everyone else if their avocado tasted rotten or weird at all and everyone said it tasted like it was seasoned just with lemon juice. By then I just plugged my nose and ate my entire portion of avocado because I didn‚Äôt want to waste anything.
It was extremely dim even for the kitchen area so I wonder if that affected the ability to ensure no rotten food served.

There is plenty of parking in the front, back, and a bigger lot further back. We ordered 4 of their happy hour drinks, they were tasty and came quickly. For the food, we opted for happy hour finger food. We got their famous fries, fried beans, and fried avocado. The fries were delicious, they are coated in some starch and fried. The avocado tasty so good, like creamy egg yolk. The fried string beans are just as you‚Äôd expect. The dipping sauces were yummy!! The portions here are very big for their happy hour price.

"My sister and I used to come here for chocolate martinis back when we were grad students up at UT circa 2010-2012. I just visited Austin again and was so glad to be able to revisit Halcyon!

Since 2002, Halcyon has been setting the gold standard for coffee shops in Austin and the rest of Texas. As the original trendsetter, it continues to impress with its perfect balance of ambiance and quality.

Their vanilla lattes are a testament to their expertise - neither too bitter nor too sweet, and served at just the right temperature.

The seating options cater to every need, whether you're tackling work on your laptop, enjoying a first date, or meeting a client.

What sets Halcyon apart is its versatility. It's not just about great coffee; they also offer delicious light bites for when you need a snack without committing to a full meal.

"Had dinner. Didn't realize that the bar menu didn't cross over into the restaurant area, and the staff were able to accommodate the food order but not the happy hour discount.

We had the mussels, beef tartare, duck, and steak.

Mussels were fantastic and delicious! They're from the bar menu.

The beef tartare was cut a little too big, and the color was brownish. They had a sprinkle of cinnamon on the bread. Unfortunately, I could not keep eating this as it reminded me of pumpkin spice cat food. I would not order it again.

The steak was cooked well, but we found the horseradish butter to be very mild and overall it seemed like a very muted dish. We were expecting some commitment to the flavor.

The duck was good, but I found it to be too salty and I also couldn't finish my plate.

I would go to the bar again for the mussels, but I would not go to the main area again.",2024-08-21,3,Wink Restaurant & Wine Bar,"1014 N Lamar Blvd, Austin, TX 78703, USA",0.9397,Positive

"This is going to be one of those reviews I post simply to remind management that the little things truly do matter and that we noticed them. So first of all I would say that the Alamo wrap is freaking ridiculously good and hearty and the service of all of the employees at this location was great. The little thing that I noticed is there was a guy named Derrick working there who was carrying these huge bins of cheese from the store into his vehicle. I'm assuming this is for catering order. When I was about to leave the store with my order he was heading towards the door at the same time. He could easily have ignored me and just tried to continue on his way given he was carrying a huge bin of cheese. Instead he smiled, greeted me, and offered to let me go ahead of him. Of course I refused but I was very impressed that despite the possibility of derailing his progress he was still willing to let the customer go first.

"What an amazing experience to eat at the Original Kerbey Lane.

We walked in and where immediately greeted and seated.

James was our server whom educated that this is the original Kerbey Lane that opened in 1980!

Love his hospitality!

The inside is so clean and has the most amazing art d√©cor hanging all over the walls.

The menu and food is what you would expect for Vegan Gluten Free options.

I ordered:
Vegan Breakfast Platter (VG)
Two Dr. Praeger‚Äôs veggie patties & tofu scramble topped with green onions & fresh diced tomatoes. Served with two half size vegan vanilla swirl pancakes.
Cost $12.99
I started with the Tofu scramble and veggie patties they both were full of flavors. My pallet was extremely happy with the texture to the tofu scramble. The veggie patties to me where a bit too soft and could have been cooked a bit longer so the inside was not mushy.

The two Vegan Gluten Free Vanilla Swirl Pancakes are the BEST and I mean the BEST pancakes I have ever eaten. They were fluffy moist and full of flavor. If you were not aware these are vegan and gluten free and wow I am honestly speechless at the texture the taste the way the cinnamon vanilla swirl enhanced the pancakes in a way that they were extremely sweet. To a point I had to take them home to finish. What an amazing tasting dish!!!

My friend ordered:
French Toast Platter* (V)
Two slices of French toast, two eggs any style & choice of all natural bacon, sausage or seasonal fresh fruit. $12.29

They advised that the French toast was cooked to perfection full fluffy and not egg tasting. They ordered over easy eggs which where cooked perfectly. The seasonal fruit however was not good. The honeydew and cantaloupe were not ripe and the strawberry's felt rubbery to a point I spat the strawberry out as soon as I took a bite of it. We both tried the fruit to ensure that they were definitely not ripe, and that the texture was off.

The cleanliness is off the charts as well as the service.

"My sandwich and salad tasted good, but it wasn‚Äôt anything exceptional. I really liked that I had the option to combine my sandwich with a salad because I was able to taste both.  I also got a cookie, but it wasn‚Äôt that good, it broke extremely easily and was a bit brittle. The chai was okay, normal. The ambience was cute though, and I really enjoyed the seating options they had. They had both indoor and outdoor seating which was great, especially if you have dogs.

"We had Sunday brunch here and can't wait to come back. Where to start...the atmosphere, employees, or food? Cenote is in a beautifully restored property with ambiance galore. Indoor and outdoor seating is available and there was hardly a wait for seating at 10:30. The employees were attentive to our needs and were happy to make suggestions about menu items. The barista was finishing our drink orders as we completed our transaction at the register. Then the food started arriving to our table. The chips, salsa and guacamole were fresh and homemade. The bacon empanada hit every savory note and the guasacaca sauce was a fantastic compliment. Everything about the OMG breakfast was delicious...eggs, breakfast potatoes, sausage, bacon, French toast and a biscuit, definitely big enough to share!!! We subbed fries for the side with our carnitas tacos and once again another winning plate. The tacos were built with cilantro, onion and salsa on top of some of the best carnitas in Austin. The fries, skin on but cut and fried in a unique way then seasoned just right with what I am assuming is a special blend. Oh and let me tell you about their breakfast tacos, they're stuffed, fresh made and delectable. The 50/50 tortilla complimented our 2  filling choices of homefried potatoes, egg and cheese and bacon, egg and cheese and the salsa was the perfect finishing touch to them. Overall there was not a single bad bite had amongst the 4 of us and all we could do on the ride home was discuss how blown away we were by a place we've driven by so many times for other dining options.

This is a great Tex Mex restaurant. Excellent service and great food. Salsa is a tad spicy and delicious. Food came out quickly even on a very busy night.

"The place for TexMex in Austin
I have been going to Matt's for many years, they have excellent food.  It's my go to place for their brisket tacos.  They are prepared just right with a wonderful slightly smokey flavor.  The meat is juicy and flavorful, the accompanying in house tortillas are excellent.  I have to admit they are a bit smaller than in the past, but remain of excellent quality.
I also enjoy their chips and salsa.  The salsa has a nice home grown flavor, the tomato is sweet and the salsa isn't too hot allowing the flavors to come through.  Some salsas have too much of a vinegar or preservative flavor, not so here.  The chips are good too, nice and large, not a pile of crumbles.

I didn't have it this time around but their fajitas are also top notch.

To top it off the restaurant is a great venue.  It has a quaint outdoors backyard area with ample tree coverage and nice fountain.  Kids love the Koi in the fountain and birds that pickup food scraps from the tables.   The backyard is enclosed by a wall giving the setting a nice sense of privacy.
They have a bar inside and out making it easy to get a drink.  All in all just a great dining experience.",2024-05-19,4,Matt's El Rancho,"2613 S Lamar Blvd, Austin, TX 78704, USA",0.9971,Positive

On top of that the atmosphere was perfect - intimate but not too loud, laid back but just a bit edgy.
Our server, however, was AWFUL. Had an attitude the entire time and looked at us like we were inconveniencing her by asking minor questions - my brother asked if anything special was done for birthdays and after a long pause she just said ""mochi"", which I never even got. We had to call her every time we wanted a drink and she didn't offer to go over the chef's selections with us. We would've much rather had been served by her apprentice who was super sweet!
