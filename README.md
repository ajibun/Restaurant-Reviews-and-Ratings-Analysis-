# **Restaurant Reviews and Ratings Analysis**

## **Project Overview**
This project aims to retrieve restaurant reviews and ratings using the Google Places API and Google Web Reviews to analyze customer sentiments, ratings, and trends over time. By leveraging Google Places API, you'll collect structured data about restaurant reviews, perform sentiment analysis, and visualize key insights. This approach ensures compliance with Googleâ€™s terms of service and offers more structured data for analysis.

## **Project Steps**

### 1. **Requirements and Setup**
**Objective**: Set up the necessary environment for interacting with the Google Places API, data storage, and analysis.

**Tasks**:
- Set up a Google Cloud project and enable the Places API.
- Obtain your API key from Google Cloud for accessing the Places API.
- Install required Python libraries: `requests`, `Pandas`, `TextBlob`, `Matplotlib`.

**Deliverables**:
- A working Python environment with API access.
- Google Places API key created and properly integrated into the script.

### 2. **Fetch Restaurant Details and Reviews**
**Objective**: Use the Google Places API to search for restaurants and retrieve reviews.

**Tasks**:
- Perform an initial search using Google Places Text Search or Nearby Search to find restaurants in a specific area (e.g., Austin, Texas).
- Retrieve place details for each restaurant, including reviews, ratings, name, location, and price level.
- Store the fetched reviews in a structured format (CSV or Pandas DataFrame) for analysis.

**Challenges**:
- Handle pagination of reviews and API rate limits.
- Handle missing or inconsistent review data.

**Deliverables**:
- A Python script that fetches restaurant details and reviews.
- Structured data stored in CSV or Pandas DataFrame.

### 3. **Data Cleaning and Preparation**
**Objective**: Clean the retrieved data for analysis.

**Tasks**:
- Clean the review text by removing unnecessary characters, symbols, or HTML elements.
- Standardize review dates and ensure consistency in the format of restaurant ratings.
- Handle any missing or incomplete data.
- Organize the data in a Pandas DataFrame for analysis.

**Deliverables**:
- Cleaned dataset with restaurant reviews and ratings, ready for analysis.

### 4. **Sentiment Analysis**
**Objective**: Perform sentiment analysis on the textual reviews to determine customer sentiment.

**Tasks**:
- Use `TextBlob` or `VADER` to perform sentiment analysis on each review.
- Assign sentiment polarity (positive, negative, or neutral) to each review.
- Add a sentiment score column to the dataset.

**Deliverables**:
- Dataset with added sentiment scores for each review.

### 5. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**
**Objective**: Analyze trends in restaurant ratings and customer sentiment over time.

**Tasks**:
- Analyze the distribution of ratings (e.g., how many restaurants have 5-star ratings, etc.).
- Visualize sentiment trends over time (e.g., are reviews becoming more positive or negative?).
- Identify correlations between review sentiment and star ratings.
- Create a word cloud or frequency analysis to understand recurring themes in customer feedback.

**Deliverables**:
- Data visualizations showing trends in restaurant ratings, sentiment, and review themes.

### 6. **Data Visualization and Reporting**
**Objective**: Create visualizations that summarize key findings.

**Tasks**:
- Visualize the distribution of ratings using histograms or bar charts.
- Generate time-series charts showing how restaurant reviews and ratings have changed over time.
- Create word clouds or frequency charts of commonly used words in reviews.
- Correlate sentiment analysis results with restaurant ratings.

**Deliverables**:
- A set of visualizations summarizing rating trends, sentiment distribution, and common themes.

### 7. **Conclusion and Insights**
**Objective**: Summarize the key insights from the data analysis and provide actionable recommendations.

**Tasks**:
- Write a summary of the findings, including trends in customer reviews and patterns in the data.
- Highlight any significant correlations between review sentiment and star ratings.
- Provide recommendations for restaurants based on customer feedback analysis.

**Deliverables**:
- A final report summarizing the insights and potential recommendations for restaurant owners.

## **Challenges and Mitigation**
- **API Rate Limits and Quotas**: Handle pagination and introduce delays between API calls to avoid exceeding limits.
- **Incomplete Reviews or Missing Data**: Filter out incomplete or inconsistent data.
- **Bias in Reviews**: Interpret sentiment analysis results in the context of subjective reviews.
