# Restaurant-Reviews-and-Ratings-Analysis
Project Plan: Restaurant Reviews and Ratings Analysis 


Project Overview:
This project aims to retrieve restaurant reviews and ratings using the Google Places API and Google Web Reviews to analyze customer sentiments, ratings, and trends over time. By leveraging Google Places API and Google Web Reviews you will collect structured data about restaurant reviews, perform sentiment analysis on the reviews, and visualize key insights. This approach ensures compliance with Googleâ€™s terms of service and offers more structured data for analysis.

Project Steps:
1. Requirements and Setup
Objective: Set up the necessary environment for interacting with the Google Places API, data storage, and analysis.
Tasks:
Set up a Google Cloud project and enable the Places API.
Obtain your API key from Google Cloud for accessing the Places API.
Install required Python libraries: requests, Pandas, TextBlob, Matplotlib.
Deliverables:
Working Python environment with API access set up.
Google Places API key created and properly integrated into the script.
2. Fetch Restaurant Details and Reviews Using Google Places API
Objective: Use the Google Places API to search for restaurants and retrieve reviews.
Tasks:
Perform an initial search using Google Places Text Search or Nearby Search to find restaurants in a specific area (e.g., Austin, Texas).
Retrieve place details for each restaurant, including user reviews, ratings, and other relevant details like name, location, and price level.
Store the fetched reviews in a structured format (e.g., CSV or Pandas DataFrame) for further analysis.
Challenges:
Handling pagination of reviews and API limits.
Handling reviews with missing or inconsistent information.
Deliverables:
Python script that fetches restaurant details and reviews using the Google Places API.
Structured data stored in CSV or Pandas DataFrame.
3. Data Cleaning and Preparation
Objective: Clean the retrieved data for analysis.
Tasks:
Clean the review text by removing unnecessary characters, symbols, or HTML elements.
Standardize review dates and ensure consistency in the format of restaurant ratings.
Handle any missing or incomplete data.
Organize the data in a Pandas DataFrame for analysis.
Deliverables:
Cleaned dataset with restaurant reviews and ratings, ready for analysis.
4. Sentiment Analysis
Objective: Perform sentiment analysis on the textual reviews to determine customer sentiment.
Tasks:
Use TextBlob or VADER to perform sentiment analysis on each review.
Assign sentiment polarity (positive, negative, or neutral) to each review based on the text.
Add a sentiment score column to the dataset.
Deliverables:
Dataset with added sentiment scores for each review.
5. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
Objective: Analyze trends in restaurant ratings and customer sentiment over time.
Tasks:
Analyze the distribution of ratings (e.g., how many restaurants have 5-star ratings, etc.).
Visualize sentiment trends over time (e.g., are reviews becoming more positive or negative?).
Identify correlations between review sentiment and star ratings.
Create a word cloud or frequency analysis of the most common terms in reviews to understand recurring themes in customer feedback.
Deliverables:
Data visualizations showing trends in restaurant ratings, sentiment, and review themes.
6. Data Visualization and Reporting
Objective: Create visualizations that summarize the key findings from the analysis.
Tasks:
Visualize the distribution of ratings using histograms or bar charts.
Generate time-series charts showing how restaurant reviews and ratings have changed over time.
Create word clouds or frequency charts of commonly used words in reviews to identify key themes.
Correlate sentiment analysis results with restaurant ratings.
Deliverables:
A set of visualizations that summarize the key insights, including rating trends, sentiment distribution, and common terms.
7. Conclusion and Insights
Objective: Summarize the key insights from the data analysis and provide actionable recommendations.
Tasks:
Write a summary of the findings, including trends in customer reviews, common feedback, and patterns in the data.
Highlight any significant correlations between review sentiment and star ratings.
Provide recommendations for restaurants based on customer feedback analysis.
Deliverables:
Final report summarizing the insights and potential recommendations for restaurant owners.

Technologies Used:
Python: Main programming language for data collection, analysis, and visualization.
Google Places API: Used to fetch restaurant details and reviews.
Pandas: For data manipulation and cleaning.
TextBlob / VADER (NLTK): For performing sentiment analysis on textual reviews.
Matplotlib / Seaborn: For data visualization.
WordCloud: For generating word clouds based on common terms in the reviews.

Challenges and Mitigation:
API Rate Limits and Quotas: Google Places API has request limits, so the script needs to handle pagination and possible delays between API calls to avoid hitting limits.
Incomplete Reviews or Missing Data: Some reviews may not have sufficient data (e.g., no text or missing date). Handling such cases by filtering out incomplete entries.
Bias in Reviews: Reviews may be subjective, so sentiment analysis needs to be interpreted in the right context.
